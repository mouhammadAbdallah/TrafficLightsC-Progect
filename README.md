# TrafficLightsCSharp-Project

C# university project to create an application that we can use to simulate the traffic on different types of intersection of streets where there are traffic lights.  

My project has organized the traffic by making the cars stop on the red light so the people who are waiting can cross the street. 

The cars change their behavior when an ambulance comes

It was two parts:
manually when the user changes the traffic lights, and automatically when everything is autonomous based on real life statistics.
